1)Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files, and allows records of those changes to be recorded 
and easily uploaded to a repository in github. Github on the 
other hand is simply a git repository hosting service that contains git files and lets you manage git repositories. 
2)The reason to use the terminal is because it is easily accessible and allows us to send simple commands to our machine
so we can create and move files, as well as other commands. 
3)Three benefits of a version control system are that you can easily see revisions made to your work,
allows many people to work on a document together, and provides users with history of the 
documents so bugs can be easily identified and fixed by a member of the team.
